# python-practice
Refresher on basic Python programming including:
1. functions/methods
2. conditionals
3. looping
4. classes
5. exceptions
6. file interactions (reading, writing, appending etc.)
7. package and module set up and importing

After refreshing on the basics, I built a small program with simple inventory management tools to solidify the principles.
To run this program simply `python3 product_inventory/`.
Note that I wrote this in Python 3.10.12, earlier versions will error on certain syntax (map() and case-match for example)
